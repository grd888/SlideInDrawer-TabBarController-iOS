# SlideInDrawer-TabBarController-iOS
An implementation of a slide-in menu inside a UITabBarController using the Coordinator pattern.

Extending further my original SlideIn Drawer for a single view controller: https://github.com/grd888/SlideInDrawer-iOS

I chose to use the Coordinator pattern because it enables a clean separation between logic and navigation.

For purposes of simplicity, I did not use MVVM in this sample code, but it would be simple to add View Models to further loosen the couplings of the view controllers.
